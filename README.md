This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), setup to work with LabelStudio.

## What is this?

A sample project outlining the basic steps to setup and run LabelStudio in a NextJS application! ðŸŽ‰

## What is this not?

A guided tutorial on the ways to work with or integrate LabelStudio. (Maybe coming in the future ðŸ¤”)

## Latest published LabelStudio version `1.4.0`

For ways to work with the existing stable version of LabelStudio frontend, please use the branch `ls-140` (this branch).
The code to run this is largely the same, but there are key differences not found in latest code on github.

### Getting Started

First, install the modules.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the server.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### Notes

Due to differing versions of React in play between LabelStudio and NextJS, `reactStrictMode` has been set to `false`.
This is important to fix the issues with LabelStudio not mounting correctly, without this you may be treated to a blank
screen even if there are no other errors. (This is being worked on internally to fix the issues presented by this
collision).

## It's alive! ðŸ¥³

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
